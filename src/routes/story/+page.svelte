		<p class="mt-4">
			You are worthwhile. At your highest of highs and even at your lowest of lows, you are worth
			more than anything. At A Lovely Flame, we believe in self-care that’s as worthy as you. We
			believe in “Treat Yourself Day”, every day. We believe in you. We want you to know you can
			believe in us too.
		</p>

		<p class="mt-4">
			With products that are vegan, cruelty-free, toxin-free and phthalate-free, you can trust that
			we love you just as much as you should. As a small business, we pride ourselves on our
			handmade products in hopes that they can bring you as much joy as they bring us, but without
			all that nasty stuff that a lot of other products include.
		</p>

		<p class="mt-4">
			Our mission at A Lovely Flame is simple. We want to inspire you to love yourself in brand new
			ways. Self-care is a huge facet of how we show ourselves we care. For us, self-care is
			learning to love all of our “less than pretty” parts of ourselves as well as dealing with the
			history of who we are and where we come from.

			Many of us are survivors of child abuse, whether we recognize it or not. The emotional
			maltreatment that’s intrinsic to past eras of raising children can cause generational trauma
			that seems impossible to escape from, but we can. It is our hope through our YouTube channel,
			social media accounts and our self-care products, to help you find you.
